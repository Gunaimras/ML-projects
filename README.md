This project focuses on building a predictive system for diabetes using the PIMA Diabetes Dataset.
It involves data collection, preliminary analysis, and data standardization using StandardScaler.
The data is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel is trained on the standardized data.
The trained model's accuracy is evaluated on both the training and test datasets, and it can be used to make predictions on new data.
